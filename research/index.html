From the early 1980s to mid-2010s, three-quarters of members newly elected to the U.S. House of Representatives had previously held public, elected office; conversely, just half of all freshmen members elected from 2016 to 2020 had previous office-holding experience. In THE AMATEUR ADVANTAGE, Rachel Porter and Sarah A. Treul draw on a wide array of data to explore the causes and consequences of amateur politicians’ rising success in congressional elections. The authors contend that several meaningful changes have made the environment of U.S. elections more favorable to amateur politicians. First, Porter and Treul demonstrate that the recent democratization of campaign resources has made it easier for candidates to fundraise without party or political connections. Second, the authors show that the rise of identity politics in U.S. elections has broadened the scope of valence characteristics that offer candidates electoral value to extend beyond past elective experience. Importantly, they demonstrate that these newly salient identities disproportionately belong to candidates without an elected background. Porter and Treul then look beyond campaigns to examine the representational and legislative consequences of electing more political neophytes to Congress. The authors find that the recent influx of amateur politicians into Congress has brought new voices into government, particularly from groups traditionally underrepresented in lawmaking. They show that these new voices help to increase representational diversity in a chamber that skews heavily towards white men and career politicians. However, Porter and Treul also demonstrate that, across multiple dimensions, political neophytes are less effective legislators. Their findings highlight critical representational trade-offs associated with electing more political neophytes.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="local:book" class="col-sm-12"> <div class="title">SOME POLITICS ARE STILL LOCAL: Representation in the Era of Nationalized Politics</div> <div class="author"> Rachel Porter </div> <div class="periodical"> <em></em> </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="award btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">E.E.

Schattschneider Award for the best dissertation in the field of American government.</p> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Over the past several decades, American congressional elections have transformed from campaigns centered around local issues into nationally oriented—"nationalized”—contests. Today, candidates are perceived to run on the same party-driven platforms, offering voters uniform choices across the country with little regard for local or state-level political dynamics. In her book, SOME POLITICS ARE STILL LOCAL, Rachel Porter argues that this understanding of modern campaigns for Congress misses the mark. Porter shows that not all congressional elections today are nationalized, and some contests are still fought over local issues. To that end, she shows that theories of strategic candidate behavior must be updated to reflect better what locally-oriented campaigning looks like in today’s era of nationalized politics. Departing from existing work that considers campaigns as either national or local, Porter conceptualizes nationalized and locally oriented campaigns as opposite ends of a spectrum of choices. She argues that many candidates adopt national party positions while simultaneously highlighting local concerns. Empirical analyses and case studies demonstrate that this definition better captures what it means to “go local” in modern campaigns for Congress. Rachel Porter embarks on an ambitious data collection effort to measure the degree to which a candidate’s campaigns are locally oriented. She collects the policy platforms for all available, ballot-eligible primary election candidates for the House of Representatives who ran from 2018 to 2024. To assess the policy implications of a candidate’s campaign position-taking on their legislative activity, she pairs natural language processing tools with causal inference methods. SOME POLITICS ARE STILL LOCAL aims to refocus the discipline’s attention in an era of nationalized expectations back toward local considerations, reminding scholars of representation that local politics are still relevant in modern campaigns.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">Peer-Reviewed Publications</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="ajps:forthcoming" class="col-sm-12"> <div class="title">Evaluating (in)experience in congressional elections</div> <div class="author"> Rachel Porter, and Sarah A.

In this article, we investigate emergence- and success-driven explanations for the declining proportion of experienced officeholders entering Congress. In our analyses, we find that the advantages traditionally afforded to experienced candidates are waning. First, we show that inexperienced candidates’ emergence patterns have changed; amateurs are increasingly apt to emerge in the same kinds of contests as their experienced counterparts. We then show that experienced candidates have lost their fundraising edge and that—for certain kinds of candidates—the value of elected experience itself has declined. Lastly, we identify other candidate characteristics as strong predictors for success in modern elections.

Employing a comprehensive collection of campaign platform text from nearly 5,000 campaign websites, we find that Democratic male and white candidates are significantly more likely to take up women’s and Black-associated issues when a candidate who possesses that identity runs in their same-party primary election. Extending our analysis to military veterans, we find that Republicans are more likely to discuss veterans’ issues when there is a military veteran in their primary; conversely, Democrats are not any more likely to discuss these issues when they run against a veteran. Looking to candidate position taking in the general election, our f indings suggest that simply the presence of candidates from underrepresented populations in elections is important to broadening substantive representation in the legislative arena.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="lsq:2022" class="col-sm-12"> <div class="title">No Experience Required: Early Donations and Amateur Candidate Success in Primary Elections</div> <div class="author"> Rachel Porter, and Tyler S.

In this article, we investigate the success of political newcomers in elections for the U.S. House of Representatives by examining a topic often overlooked in the growing literature on primaries: campaign finance. We show that, from 2016 to 2020, political newcomers saw (1) greater success in future fundraising, and (2) an increased likelihood of primary election victory when they garnered more early contributions from outside their district. This contrasts with prior elections, where early money from inside a candidate’s own congressional district served as the strongest predictor of future fundraising and electoral success.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="ps:2022" class="col-sm-12"> <div class="title">The Junior Americanist Workshop Series</div> <div class="author"> Christina Ladam, Austin Bussing, Alexander C.

Using the “Biography” pages of more than 1,500 2018 congressional campaign websites, we use a structural topic model to examine how these candidates present themselves to their constituencies. In doing this, we find great variance in the presentation styles of women running for Congress in 2018. We also find that prior political experience, more so than gender, is the primary driver in influencing how candidates (both men and women) present themselves. Experienced candidates use similar styles that highlight their past political work while amateur candidates are more likely to use “values-driven” language.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">Working Papers</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="jansixth" class="col-sm-12"> <div class="title">The Consequences of Elite Action Against Elections</div> <div class="author"> Rachel Porter, Jeffrey J.

We investigate whether American state legislators who publicly acted against the 2020 presidential election outcome sustained meaningful sanctions in response. We theorize that accountability for undemocratic activities is \textitselective—conspicuous, highly visible efforts to undermine democratic institutions face the strongest ramifications from voters, politicians, and parties. In contrast, other, less prominent actions elicit weaker responses. Our empirical analyses employ novel data on state legislators’ anti-election actions and a weighting method for covariate balance to estimate the magnitude of accountability for undemocratic behavior. The results evidence heterogeneity, with the strongest consequences targeting legislators who appeared at the U.S. Capitol on January 6th, 2021, and weaker penalties for legislators who engaged in other antagonism toward democracy. We conclude that focusing sanctions on conspicuous acts against democratic institutions could leave less apparent—but still detrimental—efforts to undermine elections unchecked, ultimately weakening democratic health.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="psrm:rr" class="col-sm-12"> <div class="title">Conceptualizing and Measuring Early Campaign Fundraising in Congressional Elections</div> <div class="author"> Colin R.

In spite of early money’s perceived importance, there is no common operationalization for money as “early.” Moreover, existing measures often fail to reflect definitional aspects of early money. In this paper, we first lay out a theoretical framework regarding the utility of early campaign fundraising for candidates. We argue that early fundraising can be expressed as two conceptually-district quantities of interest centered on either a candidate’s own fundraising performance (candidate-centered) or her fundraising performance relative to her electoral competitors (election-centered). We next lay out steps for operationalizing candidate- and election-centered measures of early fundraising. Lastly, we demonstrate that both our proposed measures for early campaign fundraising are predictive of a candidate’s future fundraising and electoral success. By putting forward a set of best practices for early money measurement and, additionally, producing off-the-shelf measures for early fundraising in U.S. House elections, we fill an important gap in scholarly research on the measurement of money in politics.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="scaling" class="col-sm-12"> <div class="title">Measuring Policy Positioning in US Congressional Elections</div> <div class="author"> Colin R.

We produce novel estimates for the policy positions of candidates who ran for the US House of Representatives between 2018 and 2022 across multiple issues areas (e.g., guns, immigration, and abortion). Through a series of validation tests, we demonstrate that our Candidate Positioning Indexes (CPIs) reliably capture latent concepts of interest from text.

We find that while the small-dollar donorate is large in scale, its financial power is relatively weak compared to the broader donor pool. We next evaluate the efficacy of small donor matching programs in elevating the voices of small donors, who more often belong to groups underrepresented in politics. We find that matching programs broadly improve candidates’ fundraising potential, but less than a third of candidates meet eligibility requirements.

We train our embeddings on a corpus of campaign platforms from U.S. House of Representatives candidates who ran between 2018 and 2022. We demonstrate that Republicans attribute extreme weather events to climate change more closely in districts with heightened climate-related disaster risk. We also demonstrate that Republicans support renewable energy investment conditional on district-level fossil fuel reliance.
