In response, electorates in major democracies are increasingly turning away from career politicians and toward “amateurs"—politicians without prior elective office-holding experience—hoping that these outsiders can disrupt partisan gridlock and elite entrenchment. Using the United States Congress as a critical case, we evaluate this expectation by linking over four decades of election data with 2.2 million records of bill sponsorship and cosponsorship. Contrary to conventional wisdom, we find that electing political amateurs to public office significantly \textitintensifies partisan divisions rather than alleviates them. Compared to retaining incumbents and/or sending experienced freshmen to Congress, electing amateurs yields representatives who attract fewer opposing-party collaborators to their own bills and offer less support to the other party’s legislation. This pattern is concerning because cross-party coalitions remain critical for functional governance in the U.S. and beyond, even amidst party polarization. We therefore caution against the premise that political outsiders can readily fix political dysfunction.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="jansixth" class="col-sm-12"> <div class="title">The Consequences of Elite Action Against Elections</div> <div class="author"> Rachel Porter, Jeffrey J.

We investigate whether American state legislators who publicly acted against the 2020 presidential election outcome sustained meaningful sanctions in response. We theorize that accountability for undemocratic activities is \textitselective—conspicuous, highly visible efforts to undermine democratic institutions face the strongest ramifications from voters, politicians, and parties. In contrast, other, less prominent actions elicit weaker responses. Our empirical analyses employ novel data on state legislators’ anti-election actions and a weighting method for covariate balance to estimate the magnitude of accountability for undemocratic behavior. The results evidence heterogeneity, with the strongest consequences targeting legislators who appeared at the U.S. Capitol on January 6th, 2021, and weaker penalties for legislators who engaged in other antagonism toward democracy. We conclude that focusing sanctions on conspicuous acts against democratic institutions could leave less apparent—but still detrimental—efforts to undermine elections unchecked, ultimately weakening democratic health.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="psrm:forthcoming" class="col-sm-12"> <div class="title">Conceptualizing and Measuring Early Campaign Fundraising in Congressional Elections</div> <div class="author"> Colin R.

In spite of early money’s perceived importance, there is no common operationalization for money as “early.” Moreover, existing measures often fail to reflect definitional aspects of early money. In this paper, we first lay out a theoretical framework regarding the utility of early campaign fundraising for candidates. We argue that early fundraising can be expressed as two conceptually-district quantities of interest centered on either a candidate’s own fundraising performance (candidate-centered) or her fundraising performance relative to her electoral competitors (election-centered). We next lay out steps for operationalizing candidate- and election-centered measures of early fundraising. Lastly, we demonstrate that both our proposed measures for early campaign fundraising are predictive of a candidate’s future fundraising and electoral success. By putting forward a set of best practices for early money measurement and, additionally, producing off-the-shelf measures for early fundraising in U.S. House elections, we fill an important gap in scholarly research on the measurement of money in politics.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="scidata" class="col-sm-12"> <div class="title">CampaignView, a database of policy platforms and biographical narratives for congressional candidates</div> <div class="author"> Rachel Porter, Colin R.

In this article, we investigate emergence- and success-driven explanations for the declining proportion of experienced officeholders entering Congress. In our analyses, we find that the advantages traditionally afforded to experienced candidates are waning. First, we show that inexperienced candidates’ emergence patterns have changed; amateurs are increasingly apt to emerge in the same kinds of contests as their experienced counterparts. We then show that experienced candidates have lost their fundraising edge and that—for certain kinds of candidates—the value of elected experience itself has declined. Lastly, we identify other candidate characteristics as strong predictors for success in modern elections.

In this article, we investigate the success of political newcomers in elections for the U.S. House of Representatives by examining a topic often overlooked in the growing literature on primaries: campaign finance. We show that, from 2016 to 2020, political newcomers saw (1) greater success in future fundraising, and (2) an increased likelihood of primary election victory when they garnered more early contributions from outside their district.

Using the “Biography” pages of more than 1,500 2018 congressional campaign websites, we use a structural topic model to examine how these candidates present themselves to their constituencies. In doing this, we find great variance in the presentation styles of women running for Congress in 2018. We also find that prior political experience, more so than gender, is the primary driver in influencing how candidates (both men and women) present themselves. Experienced candidates use similar styles that highlight their past political work while amateur candidates are more likely to use “values-driven” language.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">Working Papers</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="scaling" class="col-sm-12"> <div class="title">Measuring Policy Positioning in US Congressional Elections</div> <div class="author"> Colin R.

We train our embeddings on a corpus of campaign platforms from U.S. House of Representatives candidates who ran between 2018 and 2022. We demonstrate that Republicans attribute extreme weather events to climate change more closely in districts with heightened climate-related disaster risk. We also demonstrate that Republicans support renewable energy investment conditional on district-level fossil fuel reliance.

However, not all issues can be so easily employed to facilitate partisan messaging goals. To assess how politicians define and dramatize party distinctions over issues for which party stances are not immediately clear, I turn to America’s opioid epidemic. Assessing the topical content of opioid issue text from an original collection of congressional campaign platforms, I find the local salience of the opioid crisis to be highly predictive of politicians’ messaging behavior. Candidates from districts with a relatively high rate of opioid deaths tend to focus their opioid issue positions on CDC-endorsed public-health solutions for the crisis; alternatively, candidates from districts with a relatively low rate of opioid deaths use opioid messaging opportunities as a vehicle to purport party-defining issues that have only loose ties to America’s opioid epidemic. Pairing a novel method for multi-corpora topic modeling with text from bill summaries, floor speeches, and press releases about opioid issues, I find that incumbents carry forward their campaign messaging behaviors to Congress.

Analyzing campaign communications from candidate websites (2018–2022) alongside legislative actions from the 116th to 118th Congress, we demonstrate that bipartisan campaigning typically occurs selectively across distinct policy issues rather than as a broad legislative style. Empirical results reveal that candidates’ bipartisan messaging in specific policy areas significantly predicts their future bipartisan legislative activity, particularly in sponsorship and original co-sponsorship of legislation.
