**Scaling the Meaning of Text with Word Embeddings** (Under Contract with Cambridge Elements in Quantitative and Computational Methods for the Social Sciences) 
This book provides an accessible guide to scaling text using a word embedding approach. We begin by describing a motivating problem within the field of political science. Specifically, we review the challenges associated with scaling text for politiciansâ€™ left-right positioning on policy (e.g., taking a pro-life versus pro-choice stance on abortion); this serves as our running example throughout the book. We go on to discuss best practices for selecting corpora, extracting text of interest from documents using machine learning classifiers, and estimating word embedding models. Next, we discuss the logic behind semantic projection and explore approaches for producing an axis of meaning. In doing so, we put forth a framework for scaling the meaning of text at the document or covariate level. Subsequent chapters explore some potential avenues for evaluating measurement robustness and validation. In particular, we explore the utility of open-source and proprietary LLMs as a validation method. We also benchmark the performance of semantic protection relative to bag-of-words approaches against gold-standard human evaluations. Finally, we discuss extensions and other applications for this text scaling approach.
