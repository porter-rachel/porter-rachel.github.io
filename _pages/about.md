Welcome! I am the Notre Dame du Lac Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of Notre Dame and a Computational Social Science Faculty Fellow with the Lucy Family Institute for Data and Society. Additionally, I co-direct the [Representation and Politics in Legislatures Lab](https://rooneycenter.nd.edu/research/representation-and-politics-in-legislatures-lab/) within the Rooney Center for American Democracy. I manage multiple large-scale data collection projects, including [CampaignView](https://campaignview.org/). If you have any questions about my open data initiatives, please feel free to [reach out](mailto:rachel.porter@nd.edu)!

My research centers on American political institutions, with a particular focus on legislative politics, elections, and campaign finance. Broadly, I pair original data collections with tools for natural language processing, machine learning, and causal inference to explore how electoral incentives and institutional design impact political representation. 

I received my PhD in 2022 from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My dissertation, *Some Politics Are Still Local: Strategic Position Taking in Congress & Elections*, was awarded APSA's [E.E. Schattschneider Award](https://politicalsciencenow.com/rachel-porter-receives-the-2023-e-e-schattschneider-award/) for the best dissertation on American government. My research is published or forthcoming in outlets such as the *American Journal of Political Science*, *The Journal of Politics*, and *Legislative Studies Quarterly*. Additionally, I have a project under contract with Cambridge University Press's *Elements in Quantitative and Computational Methods* Series.

**I am on research leave for the 2025-2026 academic year**
