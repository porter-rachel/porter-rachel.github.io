Welcome! I am the Notre Dame du Lac Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of Notre Dame and a Computational Social Science Faculty Fellow with the Lucy Family Institute for Data and Society. Additionally, I co-direct the [Representation and Politics in Legislatures Lab](https://rooneycenter.nd.edu/research/representation-and-politics-in-legislatures-lab/) within the Rooney Center for American Democracy.

My research centers on American political institutions, specifically legislative politics, elections, and campaign finance. I study how district context and today's campaign finance regime shape political representation and legislative outcomes. My most recent work explores whether, when, and how politicians are held accountable for their representational behaviors. In my research I often employ original collections of text data and complex data sets composed of millions of observations. To work with these data, I use tools for large-scale data manipulation, high-performance computing, machine learning, and natural language processing techniques.

I received my PhD in 2022 from The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. My dissertation, Some Politics Are Still Local: Strategic Position Taking in Congress & Elections, was awarded APSA's [E.E. Schattschneider Award](https://politicalsciencenow.com/rachel-porter-receives-the-2023-e-e-schattschneider-award/) for the best dissertation on American government. My research is published or forthcoming in outlets such as the American Journal of Political Science, The Journal of Politics, and Legislative Studies Quarterly.
