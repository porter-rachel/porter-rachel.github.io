  title={THE AMATEUR ADVANTAGE: Understanding the Rise of Inexperience in Congress & Congressional Elections},
  author={Rachel Porter and Sarah A. Treul},
  abstract={Candidates with prior elected experience have historically seen overwhelming success in congressional elections. From the early 1980s to mid 2010s, three-quarters of members newly elected to the U.S. House of Representatives had previously held public, elected office; conversely, just half of all freshmen members elected from 2016 to 2020 had previous office-holding experience. In THE AMATEUR ADVANTAGE, Rachel Porter and Sarah A. Treul draw on a wide array of data to explore the causes and consequences of amateur politicians’ rising success in congressional elections. The au- thors contend that several meaningful changes have made the environment of U.S. elections more favorable to amateur politicians. First, Porter and Truel demonstrate that the democratization of campaign resources has made it easier for candidates to fundraise in the absence of party or po- litical connections. Second, the authors show that the rise of identity politics in U.S. elections has broadened the scope of valence characteristics that offer candidates electoral value to extend beyond past elective experience. Importantly, they demonstrate that these newly-salient identities disproportionately belong to candidates without an elected background. Porter and Treul then look beyond campaigns to examine the representational and legislative consequences of electing more political neophytes to Congress. The authors find that the recent influx of amateur politicians into Congress has brought new voices into government, particularly from groups traditionally underrepresented in lawmaking. They show that these new voices help to increase representational diversity in a chamber that skews heavily towards white men and career politicians. However, Porter and Treul also demonstrate that, across multiple dimensions, political neophytes are less effective legislators. Their findings highlight critical representational trade-offs associated with electing more political neophytes to Congress.},

  title={SOME POLITICS ARE STILL LOCAL: Representation in the Era of Nationalized Politics},
  author={Rachel Porter},
  abstract={I argue that this understanding of modern campaigns for Congress misses the mark. In my SOME POLITICS ARE STILL LOCAL, I find that not all congressional elections are nationalized, and some contests are still fought over local issues. To that end, I show that our theories of strategic candidate behavior must be updated to reflect better what locally-oriented campaigning looks like in today's era of nationalized politics. Departing from existing work that considers campaigns as either national or local, I conceptualize nationalized and locally oriented campaigns as opposite ends of a spectrum of choices. I argue that many candidates adopt national party positions while simultaneously highlighting local concerns. I show that this definition better captures what it means to “go local” in modern campaigns for Congress. I embark on an ambitious data collection effort to measure the degree to which a candidate's campaigns are locally oriented. I collect the policy platforms for all available, ballot-eligible primary election candidates for the House of Representatives who ran from 2018 to 2024. To assess the policy implications of a candidate's campaign position-taking on their legislative activity, I use pair tools for natural language processing with methods for causal inference. My book aims to refocus the discipline's attention in an era of nationalized expectations back towards local considerations, reminding scholars that local politics are still relevant in modern campaigns.},

  title={Evaluating (in)experience in congressional elections},
  author={Rachel Porter and Sarah A. Treul},
  abstract={From the 1980s to the mid-2010s, nearly three-quarters of members newly elected to the US House of Representatives had previous elected experience; however, only half of the freshmen elected from 2016 to 2020 held prior office. In this article, we investigate emergence- and success-driven explanations for the declining proportion of experienced officeholders entering Congress. In our analyses, we find that the advantages traditionally afforded to experienced candidates are waning. First, we show that inexperienced candidates’ emergence patterns have changed; amateurs are increasingly apt to emerge in the same kinds of contests as their experienced counterparts. We then show that experienced candidates have lost their fundraising edge and that—for certain kinds of candidates—the value of elected experience itself has declined. Lastly, we identify other candidate characteristics as strong predictors for success in modern elections. We demonstrate that these electorally advantageous identities overwhelmingly belong to candidates who lack elected experience.},

  title={Changing the Dialogue: Descriptive Candidacies and Position Taking in Campaigns for the US House of Representatives},
  author={Rachel Porter and Sarah A. Treul and Maura McDonald},
  abstract={Although the benefits of increasing descriptive diversity in Congress are well explored, less attention has been paid to the positive impacts of increasing descriptive diversity in elections. Employing a comprehensive collection of campaign platform text from nearly 5,000 campaign websites, we find that Democratic male and white candidates are significantly more likely to take up women’s and Black-associated issues when a candidate who possesses that identity runs in their same-party primary election. Extending our analysis to military veterans, we find that Republicans are more likely to discuss veterans’ issues when there is a military veteran in their primary; conversely, Democrats are not any more likely to discuss these issues when they run against a veteran. Looking to candidate position taking in the general election, our f indings suggest that simply the presence of candidates from underrepresented populations in elections is important to broadening substantive representation in the legislative arena.},

  title={No Experience Required: Early Donations and Amateur Candidate Success in Primary Elections},
  author={Rachel Porter and Tyler S. Steelman},
  abstract={The electoral dominance of “quality” candidates—political insiders with a history of holding office—is well-established. However, research on the recent rise in successful political neophytes is less studied. Despite longstanding trends in the predominance of experienced candidates in primary elections, nearly half of all quality candidates who ran in non-incumbent races lost to a candidate without prior electoral experience in 2018. In this article, we investigate the success of political newcomers in elections for the U.S. House of Representatives by examining a topic often overlooked in the growing literature on primaries: campaign finance. We show that, from 2016 to 2020, political newcomers saw (1) greater success in future fundraising, and (2) an increased likelihood of primary election victory when they garnered more early contributions from outside their district. This contrasts with prior elections, where early money from inside a candidate's own congressional district served as the strongest predictor of future fundraising and electoral success.},

  title={Running as a Woman? Candidate Presentation in the 2018 Midterms},
  author={Maura McDonald and Rachel Porter and Sarah A. Treul},
  abstract={The record high number of women who ran for the U.S. Congress during the midterm elections led many journalists to proclaim 2018 as another “Year of the Woman.” Although not every female candidate was successful, this large number of women running for office provides the opportunity to advance our understanding of the ways in which women present themselves to their voters. Using the “Biography” pages of more than 1,500 2018 congressional campaign websites, we use a structural topic model to examine how these candidates present themselves to their constituencies. In doing this, we find great variance in the presentation styles of women running for Congress in 2018. We also find that prior political experience, more so than gender, is the primary driver in influencing how candidates (both men and women) present themselves. Experienced candidates use similar styles that highlight their past political work while amateur candidates are more likely to use “values-driven” language.},

  title={The Consequences of Elite Action Against Elections},
  author={Rachel Porter and Jeffrey J. Harden and Emily Anderson and Géssica de Freitas and Mackenzie Dobson and Abigail Hemmen},
  abstract={Do elites who engage in undemocratic practices face democratic accountability? We investigate whether American state legislators who publicly acted against the outcome of the 2020 presidential election sustained meaningful sanctions in response. We theorize that accountability for undemocratic activities is instrumental---dispensed by external actors in pursuit of their own political goals. Accordingly, we suspect conspicuous, sensational efforts to undermine democratic institutions face ramifications while other inconspicuous, normalized actions go unchecked. Our empirical analyses employ novel data on state legislators' anti-election actions and a weighting method for covariate balance to estimate the magnitude of accountability. The results evidence heterogeneity, with the strongest penalties targeting legislators who appeared at the U.S. Capitol and weak penalties for legislators who engaged in other kinds of actions pernicious to democracy. We conclude that focusing sanctions on conspicuous acts against democratic institutions could leave less apparent---but still detrimental---efforts to undermine elections unchecked, ultimately weakening democratic health.},

  title={Conceptualizing and Measuring Early Campaign Fundraising in Congressional Elections},
  author={Colin R. Case and Rachel Porter},
  abstract={Political professionals and scholars maintain that raising money early in the election season is critical to a successful campaign, having downstream consequences on a candidate’s future fundraising potential, the stiffness of competition she will face, and her likelihood of electoral victory. In spite of early money’s perceived importance, there is no common operationaliza- tion for money as “early.” Moreover, existing measures often fail to reflect definitional aspects of early money. In this paper, we first lay out a theoretical framework regarding the utility of early campaign fundraising for candidates. We argue that early fundraising can be expressed as two conceptually-district quantities of interest centered on either a candidate’s own fundrais- ing performance (candidate-centered) or her fundraising performance relative to her electoral competitors (election-centered). We next lay out steps for operationalizing candidate- and election-centered measures of early fundraising. Lastly, we demonstrate that both our proposed measures for early campaign fundraising are predictive of a candidate’s future fundraising and electoral success. By putting forward a set of best practices for early money measurement and, additionally, producing off-the-shelf measures for early fundraising in U.S. House elections, we fill an important gap in scholarly research on the measurement of money in politics.},

  title={Measuring Policy Positioning in US Congressional Elections},
  author={Colin R. Case and Rachel Porter},
  abstract={Measures for the policy positions of political actors are essential to testing foundational questions about political representation, partisan polarization, and electoral competition. Each election season, thousands of candidates run for the US Congress, yet we lack systematic information on the policy positions of the vast majority of these electoral contenders. To that end, we pair an original collection of campaign platforms with tools for machine learning to extract and scale latent policy positions within these texts. We produce novel estimates for the policy positions of candidates who ran for the US House of Representatives between 2018 and 2022 across multiple issues areas (e.g., guns, immigration, and abortion). Through a series of validation tests, we demonstrate that our Candidate Positioning Indexes (CPIs) reliably capture latent concepts of interest from text. To underscore the utility of our measures, we find evidence of variation in issue polarization at the party level, as well as multidimensionality in policy positioning at the candidate level.},
